# Calories_Burnt_Prediction
Welcome to the Calories Burnt Prediction project! This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the number of calories burnt during physical activities. Whether you're an athlete, fitness enthusiast, or someone simply curious about monitoring your energy expenditure, this project provides a predictive model to estimate calorie burn based on various parameters.

Features
Machine Learning Model: The core of this project is a machine learning model trained on a dataset of diverse physical activities. The model is designed to predict calorie burn based on input features such as activity type, duration, heart rate, and more.

Activity Recognition: The system includes a feature for recognizing different physical activities, allowing users to input their exercise routines easily.

User-friendly Interface: The project comes with a user-friendly interface that facilitates input of activity details and provides clear predictions of the calories burnt.

Scalability: The model can be easily extended and adapted to include additional features or support a broader range of physical activities.
